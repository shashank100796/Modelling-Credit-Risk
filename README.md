# Modelling-Expected-Loss
Modelling all three aspects of the expected loss equation - (PD, LGD, and EAD) including creating a scorecard that are compliant with Basel II and Basel III regulations.

Throughout the project, several important data science techniques were used :
- Weight of evidence
- Information value
- Fine classing
- Coarse classing
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- Area Under the Curve
- Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve
- Gini Coefficient
- Kolmogorov-Smirnov
- Assessing Population Stability
- Maintaining a model

The PD model is built using Binomial Logistic Regression, whereas the LGD & EAD model is built using Beta Regression.

The modelling is done using Python Libraries like numpy, pandas, scikit learn,seaborn,matplotlib.
